      "After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold >Pixel > Galaxy Flip>Pixel  Pro>Galaxy Flip>Galaxy Flip and finally now  plus which I received on Thursday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Im on a honeymoon phase so here are the things Im enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: \n",
      "\n",
      "- Battery life: the battery life on the  plus is insane which isnt a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel  pro with a mah battery, I had terrible battery life. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since its limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable werent etc) \n",
      "\n",
      "- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Reliability: Im less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsungs slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the  Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel  pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasnt ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip  I would lose connection when Im on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why Im back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldnt let me as it wasnt compatible with my device (Flip). \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: Im enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the  plus. Im sure once the honeymoon phase is over Ill get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now Im really liking the  Plus.\n",

      "I am on  pro and willing to upgrade to  pro but with all these issues around i get a feeling that i should hold myself back\n",

      "I went to Nashville around thanksgiving. After leaving Jason Aldeans bar on Broadway at  am, I realized it was missing from my pocket. I put it on lost mode through Find My. I got a strange message via iMessage with directions on how to forget the device. Now I got an email from apple saying \"activation lock is requesting the password for iphone.\" So I checked its location and saw it's in Shenzhen, china. I erased the device but I won't forget the device bc I don't want them to factory reset it. Any idea of what they can do with the phone? Is the location infamous for stolen phones?\n",
      "I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone!

      "\n",
      "Im on a honeymoon phase so here are the things Im enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: \n",
      "\n",
      "- Battery life: the battery life on the  plus is insane which isnt a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel  pro with a mah battery, I had terrible battery life. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since its limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable werent etc) \n",
      "\n",
      "- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Reliability: Im less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsungs slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the  Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel  pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasnt ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip  I would lose connection when Im on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why Im back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldnt let me as it wasnt compatible with my device (Flip). \n",

I got a strange message via iMessage with directions on how to forget the device. Now I got an email from apple saying \"activation lock is requesting the password for iphone.\" So I checked its location and saw it's in Shenzhen, china. I erased the device but I won't forget the device bc I don't want them to factory reset it. Any idea of what they can do with the phone? Is the location infamous for stolen phones?\n",
      "I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! Its still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. Its been a full  hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as its a VERY nice and *durable* phone. Thoughts?\n",

Ive heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but thats not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera.
