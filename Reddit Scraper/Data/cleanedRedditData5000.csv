4,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",776,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

14,I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

25,Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7825,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

46,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

204,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

304,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",774,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

346,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

404,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

414,I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7822,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

446,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

525,Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7825,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

546,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

625,Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7818,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today.

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

704,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

804,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

894,iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro. The shoes and background look yellowed out even though they were taken the exact same way.

904,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

914,I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7826,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

946,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

1046,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

1104,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

1204,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

1304,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

1347,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

1404,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

1414,I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7821,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

1447,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

1547,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

1604,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

1704,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

1804,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

1847,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

1904,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7832,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

1947,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

2014,I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today.

2104,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

2204,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

2247,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

2304,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

2347,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

2404,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

2425,Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7827,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

2447,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

2525,Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7825,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…”

2604,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

2704,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",767,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

2804,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",774,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

2847,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks.

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

2947,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

3004,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

3104,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

3204,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

3247,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

3294,iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro. The shoes and background look yellowed out even though they were taken the exact same way.

3304,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7826,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

3347,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

3447,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

3504,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

3604,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",777,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

3704,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",775,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

3747,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

3804,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7823,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

3847,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

3947,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

4004,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

4104,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",767,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

4204,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

4247,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

4304,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7823,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

4347,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

4414,I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket.

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today.

4504,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

4604,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

4647,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

4704,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

4747,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

4804,15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

4825,Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7825,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

4847,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

4925,Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7826,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

4947,Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

4972,I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

Upgrading from 7 to 11 felt HUGE and I was expecting that again, especially with this being a Pro model.",978,422,2023-11-24 09:40:37,iPhone   Pro   hour,"gift iPhone   pro deliver yesterday morning yesterday evening send Network not sort contract

I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro. The shoes and background look yellowed out even though they were taken the exact same way.

Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it.
