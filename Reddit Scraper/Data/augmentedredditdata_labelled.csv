Why is the demand for the iPhone 15 series so high this year?,"I thought iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro series already had pretty high demand given they were hard to get for months. But the 15 Pros got backordered within ~15 minutes, and I haven’t seen Apple Stores everywhere this busy in a long time. 

The 15 Pros have nice improvements, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or flashy compared to the 14 Pros. The regular 15s got a really good upgrade this year and nice colors, but those aren’t the ones that seem to be selling out as fast.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",776,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7825,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",774,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",767,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone!

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7818,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7824,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7822,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Max burn in issues,"I got my iPhone 15 pro max on release day and have been loving it so far. I had heard that some people were experiencing burn in issues on theirs, but I wasn’t really noticing anything on mine until a couple nights ago when I started to see a small amount of what looked like ghosting. Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it.

Why is the demand for the iPhone 15 series so high this year?,"I thought iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro series already had pretty high demand given they were hard to get for months. But the 15 Pros got backordered within ~15 minutes, and I haven’t seen Apple Stores everywhere this busy in a long time. 

The 15 Pros have nice improvements, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or flashy compared to the 14 Pros. The regular 15s got a really good upgrade this year and nice colors, but those aren’t the ones that seem to be selling out as fast.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street.

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7821,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7832,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",774,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Why is the demand for the iPhone 15 series so high this year?,"I thought iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro series already had pretty high demand given they were hard to get for months. But the 15 Pros got backordered within ~15 minutes, and I haven’t seen Apple Stores everywhere this busy in a long time. 

The 15 Pros have nice improvements, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or flashy compared to the 14 Pros. The regular 15s got a really good upgrade this year and nice colors, but those aren’t the ones that seem to be selling out as fast. 

So, what do you think is making so many people upgrade this year?",466,689,2023-09-23 11:49:19,demand iPhone   series high year,"think iPhone   Pro   Pro series pretty high demand give hard month   pro get backordere ~ minute not see Apple Stores busy long time

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7823,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone!

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",767,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",774,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone!

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7828,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7819,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7829,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",775,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Max burn in issues,"I got my iPhone 15 pro max on release day and have been loving it so far. I had heard that some people were experiencing burn in issues on theirs, but I wasn’t really noticing anything on mine until a couple nights ago when I started to see a small amount of what looked like ghosting. Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it.

Why is the demand for the iPhone 15 series so high this year?,"I thought iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro series already had pretty high demand given they were hard to get for months. But the 15 Pros got backordered within ~15 minutes, and I haven’t seen Apple Stores everywhere this busy in a long time. 

The 15 Pros have nice improvements, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or flashy compared to the 14 Pros. The regular 15s got a really good upgrade this year and nice colors, but those aren’t the ones that seem to be selling out as fast.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street.

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7824,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7824,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Why is the demand for the iPhone 15 series so high this year?,"I thought iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro series already had pretty high demand given they were hard to get for months. But the 15 Pros got backordered within ~15 minutes, and I haven’t seen Apple Stores everywhere this busy in a long time. 

The 15 Pros have nice improvements, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or flashy compared to the 14 Pros. The regular 15s got a really good upgrade this year and nice colors, but those aren’t the ones that seem to be selling out as fast. 

So, what do you think is making so many people upgrade this year?",465,689,2023-09-23 11:49:19,demand iPhone   series high year,"think iPhone   Pro   Pro series pretty high demand give hard month   pro get backordere ~ minute not see Apple Stores busy long time

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7826,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,"notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone   pro document temperature Ill leave

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,"long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel   pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally   plus receive Thursday

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me.

iPhone 15 Pro Max burn in issues,"I got my iPhone 15 pro max on release day and have been loving it so far. I had heard that some people were experiencing burn in issues on theirs, but I wasn’t really noticing anything on mine until a couple nights ago when I started to see a small amount of what looked like ghosting. Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it. Will likely go to the Apple Store some time this week to see what they can do about it. The first image is a bit exaggerated, but came straight out of another iPhone’s camera.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",776,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s serial publication optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera break through bad quality video summation calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign folding member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone class plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long class handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel professional > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad phase angle battery life Pixel non professional mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well ordinarily banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel professional know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here.

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd sulfur party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image exclusive time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive slam take slam WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible slam dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member slam dance go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy regretful ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.9113,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

The first Pinoy to buy iPhone 15 on local release was also the first one to buy iPhone 14 last year,"I almost don’t care, your money, your rules. But this was also the same person who said in an interview na one of the ways kaya siya nakabili last year eh dahil sa ~~pambuburaot~~ diskarteng Pinoy. ie, minsan, nanghihingi na lang siya ng pagkain sa mga kawork para ipunin yung pera instead na gumastos pa.

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",774,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone stamp battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad occupy battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app endure well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible fellow member shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling come up connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus longsighted receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot riff dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend call for camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally station phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend call for m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase inauspicious annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Positive,0.2567,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know unfit battery life Pixel pro mah timber battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present fearful rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter fall behind impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack unfit quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready unfit struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time take iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Positive,0.3775,Neutral,0.0

So I checked its location and saw it's in Shenzhen, china. I erased the device but I won't forget the device bc I don't want them to factory reset it. Any idea of what they can do with the phone? Is the location infamous for stolen phones?",3006,496,2024-02-01 18:35:17,Stolen iPhone   pro,go Nashville thanksgiving day leave Jason Aldeans ignition lock bar Broadway realize miss pocket lose mode find receive strange message iMessage direction forget device receive email apple say activation lock request password iphone check location see Shenzhen e mail china erase device will forget device bc want factory reset idea phone location infamous steal go forth phone,Negative,-0.875,Negative,-0.4939
I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7825,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,notice phone get particularly unmanageable hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone metre professional document temperature Ill leave get hot m afraid touch hurt leg pocket ve hear support hot charge social medium s case phone actually cool touch browse slightly warm charging minute phone phone pipe hot take work decide catch hot camera phone pretty difficult reading light ardent contemplative reach F. ve reset restore try make phone restore thing time m take genius bar tomorrow not hold hope,Positive,0.625,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro. The shoes and background look yellowed out even though they were taken the exact same way.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",767,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max reliableness > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat amount foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android amount long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app thumb etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle receipt normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy phallus time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far snotty nosed iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well localize banking app etc reliability m worried x wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow supporter shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incidental week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member x download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Positive,0.0846,Neutral,0.0

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7822,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone pro document temperature inauspicious leave get hot m afraid touch hurt leg pocket ve hear support hot charge social medium s case phone actually cool touch browse slightly warm charging minute concord phone phone min pipe hot take work decide catch hot camera phone pretty difficult reading light reflective reach F. ve reset restore try take a crap phone restore photographic camera thing time m take genius bar tomorrow not hold hope,Positive,0.2962,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal.

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me.

iPhone 15 Pro Max burn in issues,"I got my iPhone 15 pro max on release day and have been loving it so far. I had heard that some people were experiencing burn in issues on theirs, but I wasn’t really noticing anything on mine until a couple nights ago when I started to see a small amount of what looked like ghosting. Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it. Will likely go to the Apple Store some time this week to see what they can do about it. The first image is a bit exaggerated, but came straight out of another iPhone’s camera.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy lifetime character Flip lifetime > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard exploit come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long path near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1218,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference.

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon booster phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know tag bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially wandering Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck in point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need re start phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.2582,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7828,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,notice phone get gain particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot raging iPhone pro document temperature Ill leave get hot m afraid touch hurt branch readjust pocket ve hear support hot charge social medium s case phone actually cool touch browse slightly warm charging minute phone phone pipe up hot take work decide catch hot camera phone pretty difficult reading light reflective reach F. ve reset restore try make phone restore thing time m take genius bar tomorrow not hold hope,Positive,0.2502,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it. Will likely go to the Apple Store some time this week to see what they can do about it. The first image is a bit exaggerated, but came straight out of another iPhone’s camera.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones specially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App dreadful quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung specially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video confutable calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose association m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk electric battery right m like Plus,Positive,0.0954,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus postulate insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come nomadic long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried operate wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident workweek like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member operate download app not barrage let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy metier fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon stage thing m enjoy far iPhone carry bombardment life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability receipt m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon stage Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief predict phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app non camera quality android come long mode near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design io haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus risky m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy io quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.3759,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,recollective year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy turn a loss fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come recollective way near iPhones especially limit phone invite holler model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive pellet take pellet WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible pellet dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.2977,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here.

I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone legal brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat issue forth foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android issue forth long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m folding worried go g wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image tone single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.0699,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially account limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum involve restart phone lastly pass incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy g time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill bother ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.0699,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel abbreviated pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldaway flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially galaxy limit phone model s series optimise degree foldaway not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point extend recalibrate google map out time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Neutral,-0.0184,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",774,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year fistful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried xtc wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready professional bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point in conclusion recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member xtc download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like humanoid Plus,Negative,-0.3471,Neutral,0.0

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel picture element > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane throw not hard exploit come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s sentence series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone finally incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Neutral,-0.0452,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality addition app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image one time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive nip take nip WTF samsung slow shutter speed unacceptable shutter lag impossible nip dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity mechanical man pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.5819,Neutral,0.0

Stolen iPhone 15 pro,"I went to Nashville around thanksgiving. After leaving Jason Aldeans bar on Broadway at 2 am, I realized it was missing from my pocket. I put it on lost mode through Find My.

It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do?

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > beetleweed fold > Pixel > beetleweed Flip > Pixel pro > beetleweed Flip > beetleweed Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios tactile feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc flick reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place positive Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible smattering device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Positive,0.427,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year fistful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally supporter ask camera particularly crack bad exploit quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke supporter ask m iPhone supporter decide Yo Chi professional frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.7914,Neutral,0.0

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone!

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7825,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally written report hot iPhone pro text file temperature Ill leave get hot m air pocket afraid touch hurt leg pocket ve hear support hot charge social medium s subject phone actually cool touch browse slightly warm charging minute phone phone pipe hot take work decide catch hot camera phone pretty difficult reading light reflective reach F. ve reset restore try make phone restore thing time m take genius bar bob hope tomorrow not hold hope,Positive,0.5995,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality.

iPhone 15 Pro Max burn in issues,"I got my iPhone 15 pro max on release day and have been loving it so far. I had heard that some people were experiencing burn in issues on theirs, but I wasn’t really noticing anything on mine until a couple nights ago when I started to see a small amount of what looked like ghosting. Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it. Will likely go to the Apple Store some time this week to see what they can do about it. The first image is a bit exaggerated, but came straight out of another iPhone’s camera.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel professional > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel professional mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model mho series optimise degree foldable not etc App mode quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel professional know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m picture element iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios frosty quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference.

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",774,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd political party app smarthome app cook run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag out of the question shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum acquaint need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi non frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7818,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone pro document temperature Ill leave get hot m afraid touch hurt leg pocket ve hear support hot charge sociable medium headphone s case phone really cool touch browse slightly warm charging minute phone phone pipe hot take work decide catch hot camera phone pretty difficult reading light reflective reach F. ve reset earphone restore try make phone warm up restore thing time m take genius bar tomorrow not hold hope,Positive,0.7264,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it. Will likely go to the Apple Store some time this week to see what they can do about it. The first image is a bit exaggerated, but came straight out of another iPhone’s camera.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful humanoid phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality humanoid come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong khi iPhone humanoid phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung trusted especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map come on time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Positive,0.3245,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally addition receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life addition insane not humanoid hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera prime android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise map out degree foldable not etc App prime app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go folding wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video prime Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad prime video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone addition m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here.

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,recollective year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > ring Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery long life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come recollective way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture fearsome impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place commonwealth of australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.6122,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone inauspicious history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not punishing feat come foldable flip know optimize bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present galax rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps give suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Positive,0.6195,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy pen up > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design somersaulting ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend pelt along ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point flip recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile data point need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here.

I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane non hard feat come foldable flip seed know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone serial publication model s series optimise degree foldable non etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone right field camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man non ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone last incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app non let non compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.8161,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone potassium XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday k honeymoon phase thing k enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well beetleweed design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability k worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter upper shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate care google map time Flip lose connection k mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask k iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR k enjoy time iPhone plus k sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right k like Plus,Positive,0.3461,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here.

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",777,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone poorly finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera timber android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App timber app well design ios haptic feedback particularly present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video timber Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack earpiece bad timber video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.13,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here.

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",775,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane non hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera select android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable non etc App select app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video select Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad select video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man crevice non ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose asset connection m mobile datum issue forth need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app non let non compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.7157,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here.

Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",770,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone intermediate history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model atomic number series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel chi questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling lifespan connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck head recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1208,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend involve camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip suffer connection m mobile datum telephone need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend involve humanoid m iPhone exploit friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.4536,Neutral,0.0

Stolen iPhone 15 pro,"I went to Nashville around thanksgiving. After leaving Jason Aldeans bar on Broadway at 2 am, I realized it was missing from my pocket. I put it on lost mode through Find My.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

iPhone 15 Pro Poor Quality Photos,I just got the new iPhone 15 Pro with trading in my 12 Pro. I immediately noticed a huge difference in picture quality. I use my phone daily to photograph and sell sneakers online so the camera is the most important thing to me. I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium television app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried break wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow galaxy shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection battery m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend determine Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia determine sign member break download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.
Are you noticing any of these? Did I just not get to play long enough?

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone longsighted model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality professional terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling form connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like jest prison term friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.7408,Neutral,0.0

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7824,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,notice phone get especially hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone pro document temperature Ill leave get hot m afraid touch hurt leg pocket ve call up hear support hot charge social medium s case phone actually cool touch blistering browse slightly warm charging minute phone phone pipe hot take work decide catch hot camera phone pretty difficult reading light reflective reach F. ve readjust restore try make phone restore non thing time m take genius bar tomorrow not hold hope,Positive,0.2502,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I talked with apple to try and see if there was a software issue or maybe I got a defective product but they said everything looked normal. Here is a picture of some Nike Air Max shoes taken in my photo light box with the 15 Pro and the second brighter true to color is the 12 Pro. The shoes and background look yellowed out even though they were taken the exact same way.

iPhone 15 Pro Max burn in issues,"I got my iPhone 15 pro max on release day and have been loving it so far. I had heard that some people were experiencing burn in issues on theirs, but I wasn’t really noticing anything on mine until a couple nights ago when I started to see a small amount of what looked like ghosting. Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it. Will likely go to the Apple Store some time this week to see what they can do about it. The first image is a bit exaggerated, but came straight out of another iPhone’s camera.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,confutative long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone suffer camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag unacceptable shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign thousand member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios queerness right m like Plus,Negative,-0.8059,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5).

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference.

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

But during this time I got to play with it, I was upgrading for an iPhone 11 (normal, not pro) and was so excited for the huge difference, but I just didn’t feel it?!

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",768,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m relish far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App pel quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable sentence image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend involve camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro approximate know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend involve m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m relish time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.7828,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7821,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,notice phone get particularly hot phone ve hear report people have abnormally hot iPhone pro document temperature Ill leave get hot m photographic camera afraid touch trauma leg pocket ve hear support hot charge social medium s case phone actually raging cool touch browse slimly warm charging minute phone phone pipe hot take work decide catch hot camera phone pretty difficult reading light reflective reach F. peg ve reset restore try make phone restore thing time m take genius bar tomorrow not hold hope,Negative,-0.1295,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it.

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",772,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality barrage fire app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m concern go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yogurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip direful TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon high risk phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.8004,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > cry Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery liveliness battery liveliness plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery liveliness Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery liveliness social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter beguile speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad scramble reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like unmarried joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Positive,0.5524,Neutral,0.0

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",773,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone Battery life battery life plus insane not foldaway hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried style go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point workweek recalibrate google map time Flip lose joining m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here.

After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",765,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful revel android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > incorrect Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m enjoy far iPhone alternate Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign extremity go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m enjoy time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios oddity right m like Plus,Negative,-0.1953,Neutral,0.0

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket.

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",771,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,long year handful android phone finally iPhone brief phone history iPhone iPhone XS liquid ecstasy > Galaxy fold > Pixel > foldaway Galaxy Flip > Pixel pro > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip finally plus receive Thursday m honeymoon phase thing m relish far iPhone exaltation Battery life battery life plus insane not hard feat come foldable flip know bad battery life Pixel pro mah battery terrible battery life social medium app camera quality android come long way near iPhones especially limit phone model s series optimise degree foldable not etc App quality app well design ios haptic feedback present rd party app smarthome app run well banking app etc reliability m worried go wrong iPhone android phone iPhone camera usable image single time Samsung especially Pixel clip capture impressive shot take shot WTF samsung slow shutter speed shutter lag impossible shot dog pixel questionable video quality Pro terrible camera literally friend ask camera crack bad quality video calling connectivity pixel pro know connectivity issue man not ready bad struggle reception normally phone gps suck point recalibrate google map time Flip lose connection m mobile datum need restart phone lastly incident week like joke friend ask m iPhone friend decide Yo Chi frozen yoghurt place Australia decide sign member go download app not let not compatible device Flip TLDR m relish time iPhone plus m sure honeymoon phase Ill annoy ios quirk right m like Plus,Negative,-0.5477,Neutral,0.0

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

I had an iPhone 15 Pro… for 12 hours!,"I was gifted an iPhone 15 Pro, delivered yesterday morning, by yesterday evening it was being sent back (Network couldn’t sort out my contract).

Do you feel you’ve had a big difference from your previous upgrade? I took the same photo on my 11 and 15th and unless you zoomed in, you couldn’t really see the difference. The sound quality on the 15pro I could hear every breath when recording and I also felt like white colours were ‘too strong’ on the screen making videos/photos feel fake on the 15 pro compared to read on the 11.

I found an iPhone 15 max,"I was riding my moped and it was laying in the street. It looked like it had been run over a couple of times, but when I got it home I was surprised to find that it was only the screen protector that was cracked, and the case protected the rest of the phone! It’s still in perfect condition! However the phone was dead, and it has Siri locked without the password, otherwise I would have found out who it belongs to already. It’s been a full 12 hours and no one has called it or put it into lost mode, so I have no way of knowing who to give it back to or to find out who owns it. What do I do? Im sure whoever lost it would love to have it back, as it’s a VERY nice and *durable* phone.

iPhone 15 Pro Max burn in issues,"I got my iPhone 15 pro max on release day and have been loving it so far. I had heard that some people were experiencing burn in issues on theirs, but I wasn’t really noticing anything on mine until a couple nights ago when I started to see a small amount of what looked like ghosting. Upon further inspection, it is definitely burn in. Putting a dark gray image up at low brightness really reveals it. Will likely go to the Apple Store some time this week to see what they can do about it. The first image is a bit exaggerated, but came straight out of another iPhone’s camera.

Temperature of my iPhone 15 Pro Max while on the phone for 5 mins.,"So I have noticed with my phone that it gets particularly hot only when I am on a phone call. I’ve heard reports of people having abnormally hot iPhone, 15 pros but no one documenting the temperature so I’ll just leave this here. 

It gets so hot that I’m afraid to touch it and it hurts my leg in my pocket. I’ve heard very supports of it being hot while charging or on social media but that’s not the case of me, my phone is actually cool to the touch when browsing and only slightly warm all charging. After five minutes of being on the phone my phone is piping hot so I took it to Work and I decided to catch just how hot it was on camera. Here is the back of my phone which is pretty difficult to get a reading on because it’s so light and reflective, but it reaches 108°F.

I’ve done a full re-reset and restore even tried making a phone call before I restore from my back up and it’s the same thing every time. I’m taking it into the genius bar tomorrow and see what they say but I don’t hold much hope.",7830,1071,2023-09-26 16:35:15,temperature iPhone   Pro Max phone   min,Phone notice get private hot phone ve hear report people you have abnormally hot hot iPhone pro document temperature Ill leave learn get hot m scattered touch wounds leg pocket ve hear support,Negative,-0.0772,Neutral,0.0
Please don’t buy an iPhone 15 today,"PSA.

Your current phone works fine. You can make calls on it and call for emergency services. Nobody you call or text will be able to see you’re on a new phone you can’t afford. Nobody cares about the color of your phone or how apple improved the camera a smidge to charge you $1500+. 

Nobody cares that they changed the charging port. People want to communicate with you and that is all. Please stay strong and focus on your journey. 

—I rarely go to the mall but I dropped off a present for a friend who works the Apple Store in one. I was shocked at the line that wove all throughout the mall to get this phone! The mall even hires police officers. With our economy the way it is, folks being so stretched, inflation out the rear, I never thought I’d witness what I saw today. 

I asked a guy in line what the big deal was about this phone. He shrugged and said “they changed the charging port. Otherwise not much…” 

Hold your older phones high and cherish them! They work just fine (unless they don’t then still get a cost effective phone 😂).

15 Plus thoughts - back to iPhone after 3 years,"After three long years and handful of android phones, I am finally back to using an iPhone. Brief phone history since I used an iPhone: iPhone XS Max>Galaxy Fold 2>Pixel 5> Galaxy Flip3>Pixel 6 Pro>Galaxy Flip4>Galaxy Flip5 and finally now 15 plus which I received on Thursday. 

I’m on a honeymoon phase so here are the things I’m enjoying so far being back on an iPhone: 

- Battery life: the battery life on the 15 plus is insane which isn’t a hard feat coming from foldable and flips which are known for bad battery life. But even on the Pixel 6 pro with a 5000mah battery, I had terrible battery life. 

- Social media app camera quality: android has come a long way but is still nowhere near iPhones and especially since it’s limited to phone models (the s series were optimised to some degree but foldable weren’t etc) 

- App quality: apps are just better designed on iOS. Haptic feedback is present across 3rd party apps, my smarthome apps run much better, banking apps etc. 

- Reliability: I’m less worried about something going wrong on my iPhone than when I had an android phone. The iPhone camera will take a usable image every single time, Samsung and especially Pixel captured some very impressive shots but sometimes it takes shots where I go WTF. Samsung’s slow shutter speed and shutter lag made it impossible for me to take shots of my dogs. The pixel had questionable video quality and the 6 Pro had a terrible front camera that literally had my friend ask if my camera was cracked because of how bad the quality was when video calling. Next is connectivity, the pixel 6 pro was known for its connectivity issues but man I wasn’t ready for how bad it was. It struggled to get reception where there normally would be in other phones, the gps sucked to the point I had to recalibrate google maps every time I used it. Then with my Flip 4 I would lose connection when I’m on mobile data and would need to restart my phone to get it back.

Lastly I had an incident last week that I like to joke about with my friends when they ask why I’m back on an iPhone. I was out with friends and we decided to get Yo Chi (a frozen yoghurt place here in Australia) I decided to sign up to become a member, but when I went to download the app it wouldn’t let me as it wasn’t compatible with my device (Flip5). 

TLDR: I’m enjoying my time back on an iPhone with the 15 plus. I’m sure once the honeymoon phase is over I’ll get annoyed with iOS quirks. But for right now I’m really liking the 15 Plus.",769,401,2023-09-30 07:39:32,  plus thought iPhone   year,iPhone iPhone XS Max > Galaxy fold > Pixel > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip > Galaxy Flip find yet become Thursday m phase honeymoon thing m enjoy making iPhone Battery life,Positive,0.4939,Neutral,0.0

It’s incredibly inconvenient, as the time I actually want to wake up is 6:38 AM.",3048,1081,2023-12-19 07:49:34,iPhone   alarm fail happen,alarm alarm fail alarm alarm alarm sequential alarm alarm photo alarm sequential alarm sound wake alarm really soundwake find early alarm stay set alarm alarm alarm alarm,Negative,-0.9867,Negative,-0.7096
