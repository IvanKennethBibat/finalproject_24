# Comparison of Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis Models
## Ivan Bibat
This is the Project Development repository for the final year research project. In this repository, the code for the scraping, pre-processing and sentiment classification of the specified dataset may be found, alongside the transformer-based sentiment analysis models trained and tested using the processed dataset. The goal for the project is to analyse and evaluate different transformer-based pre-trained sentiment analysis models with the retrieved data, then evaluate and compare the metrics of these models.

## Guide
Python 3.12
Anaconda Environment
PyTorch

twitter-roberta-base-sentiment, BERT-base-uncased, and distilBERT-base-uncased are the three transformer-based models used for training and evaluation in this project.
roBERTa model: https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment
BERT model: https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased
distilBERT model: https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased

The requirements.txt file allows for the installation of the required dependencies for the project. The following code will install the dependencies by typing the following into the Anaconda Prompt:
pip install -r requirements.txt
