# Comparison of Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis Models
## Ivan Bibat
This is the Project Development repository for the final year research project. In this repository, the code for the scraping, pre-processing and sentiment classification of the specified dataset may be found, alongside the transformer-based sentiment analysis models trained and tested using the processed dataset. The goal for the project is to analyse and evaluate different transformer-based pre-trained sentiment analysis models with the retrieved data, then evaluate and compare the metrics of these models.
